### Intoduction

This is a simple web application made for educational purposes that visualizes the TCP/IP protocol using React. It provides an interactive and animated visualization of the TCP/IP protocol, including the three-way handshake, data transmission, and connection termination.

The application was made to help me get a better understanding of how how the TCP/IP protocol works in a fun and engaging way.

### Resources Used

If you want to learn more about the TCP/IP protocol, I recommend checking out the [TCP/IP protocols documentation](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/aix/7.2.0?topic=protocol-tcpip-protocols) from IBM. It provides a comprehensive overview of the TCP/IP protocol suite, including its architecture, protocols, and applications.
